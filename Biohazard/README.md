		Hint 1: Crest 1 has been encoded twice
		Hint 2: Crest 1 contanis 14 letters
		Note: You need to collect all 4 crests, combine and decode to reavel another path
		The combination should be crest 1 + crest 2 + crest 3 + crest 4. Also, the combination is a type of encoded base and you need to decode it
